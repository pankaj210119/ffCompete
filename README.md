# ffCompete

<p> i am pankaj a student studying in btech . hoping to create something imapactful . </p>
<p> This project is based on the idea i got when i was playing an online multiplayer FREE FIRE . <p>
<p> The basic idea is pepole who have skill can showcase them and earn some money by playing and winning the tournaments .
it will give pepole a way to earn money through their skills whom they though useless. </p>
as we will be the first players to do this specifically for the general audeince it will be benificial for long term.

# Company support

<p> After talking with the company if they collaborate we can make them partner and do some changes to make authentication easy .
